# MindScreen

## Informative movie/TV show website displaying TMDB API fetched data

Second project done as part of MindSwap's 2021 class curriculum, incorporating HTML, CSS and JavaScript (+ jQuery).

This project implements [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)'s API, allowing us to fetch several data from movies and TV shows, e.g. original title, release date, synopsis, cast and crew members (along with their own subset of data), in order to display it on a three-piece responsive website with a landing page, a results page and a details page.
The API also grants us access to available visual media, such as images (e.g. movie posters and cast photos) and videos (e.g. trailers and featurettes).

MindScreen allows the user to search for the intended movie or TV show, which will in turn display all available results according to the inserted query. Clicking on an item of this results page will then send the user to that item's specific page, which contains filmographic and visual information about the movie/TV show and involved persons. This page displays different information depending on whether the choice refers to a movie or a TV show, such as season and episode in the latter case. 
The landing page also presents a five-item carousel showing currently popular movies and TV shows.
